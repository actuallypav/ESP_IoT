### IoT Microcontroller Scripts

This repository currently contains:

- A basic setup for the ESP-8266 NodeMCU with a temperature and humidity sensor configuration. The device connects to AWS IoT Cloud, reads sensor data, and publishes it via MQTT - find it [here](ESP_8266_TempHum/README.md).

This is a starting point for building various IoT solutions with ESP8266. Future contributions will add more sensors, cloud integrations, and device control features.
