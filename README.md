## Overview
This Repository is meant as an epicentre of scripts that can be used to control different Microcontrollers. Although still at it's starting point, future contributions will support more sensors, cloud integrations and device control features.

### Current contents:

- A basic setup for the ESP-8266 NodeMCU with a temperature and humidity sensor configuration. The device connects to AWS IoT Cloud, reads sensor data, and publishes it via MQTT - find it [here](ESP_8266_TempHum/README.md).

This is a starting point for building various IoT solutions with ESP8266. Future contributions will add more sensors, cloud integrations, and device control features.
